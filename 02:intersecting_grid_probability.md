Let $G$ be the 2-dimensional, infinite, unit-square-grid graph. If you drop a straight line segment of length $L$ onto the planar drawing of $G$, what is the maximum (over all lengths $L\geq0$) probability of intersecting exactly 1 edge of $G$?\n
What about the $d$-dimensional grid?\n
What about intersecting $n$ arcs?\n
What is the probability if, instead of maximizing, we have a random length according to some suitable distribution?
