Given a connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, a min-cut is a partition of the vertex set $V(G)$ into $$(X,Y)$$ such that the number of edges between $X$ and $Y$, $$\left|E(G) \cap E(K_{X,Y})\right|,$$ is minimized. What is the largest number of distinct min cuts $G$ can have?

Double dollars are because latex in markdown on github shits the bed otherwise.
