Consider an infinite sequence (X_n) of independent observations from a CDF F, admitting a density f. We say X_i is a record value if X_i > X_j, for all 0 <= j < i, where we set X_0 = 0.
Let I_i be the indicator of the event that X_i is a record. Prove that (I_i) is an infinite sequence of independent Bernoulli(1/i) rvs.
Let T_i be the sequence of record times; T_1 = 1; T_i = min{j > T_{i-1} : Z_j = 1}. Define R_k = X_{T_k} as the k-th record value. Prove that the density f_r(y) of R_r is (-ln(1-F(y)))^(r-1)/(r-1)!*f(y).
Let D_{i+1}=T_{i+1}-T_i. Let r >= 2, k >= 1. Prove that P(D_r = k) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1}{ (-1)^i * C(k-1, i) * (i + 2)^(-r) }.
Prove that the joint density of the first n record values R_1,...,R_n is given by f_{1,...,n}(y_1,...,y_n) = f(y_n) * product_{i=1}^{n-1}{ f(y_i) / (1 - F(y_i)) * I{y_1<...<y_n} }.
