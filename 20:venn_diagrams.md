Find a 4-Venn diagram (one made of 4 sets/curves/regions/...).  
Prove there cannot exist a 4-Venn diagram made of four circles.  
Prove that an $n$-Venn diagram can only be (rotationally) $n$-symmetric for prime $n$.  
Prove that, for any (simple, closed) 2D curve such that any two copies intersect in at most $N$ points, there is some $M_N$ such that there cannot exist an $M_N$-Venn diagram made of $M_N$ such curves.
