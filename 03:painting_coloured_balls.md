You have $n$ balls coloured $1$ to $n$. If at one step you pick two random balls, and paint the second the colour of the first, what is the expected number of steps until all balls are the same colour?  
What if you make sure the two balls chosen at every step are of distinct colours?  
In the case of the first question, assume the final colour is $1$. If you start with $j$ balls of colour $1$, and the other $n-j$ balls are coloured $2$ to $n-j+1$, what is now the expected number of steps?
