Inspired by [this video][1], prove that the expected value of the maximum of $m$ independently thrown $n$-sided dice equals
$E(M) = n-\frac{1}{m+1}\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{m}\binom{m+1}{\ell}B_\ell n^{1-\ell}$, where $B_\ell$
is the $\ell$-th Bernoulli number.  
Also, show that $E(M) = n\frac{m}{m+1}+\frac12+O_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac1n\right)$ and $E(M) = n+o_{m\to\infty}(1)$.
