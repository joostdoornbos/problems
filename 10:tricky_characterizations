Assume we have a sample (X_n) of size n >= 2 from a distribution with density function f_X. Assume X_(1) and X_(2)-X_(1) are independent. Here X_(1) is the first order statistic. Prove X is exponentially distributed.
Suppose that X and Y are independent and identically distributed, with mean mu and variance sigma^2, such that X + Y and X - Y are independent. Prove that X and Y are normally distributed.
