Consider three random variables $X, Y$ and $Z$, and their correlations $\varrho_{XY}, \varrho_{XZ}$ and $\varrho_{YZ}$. Find applicable bounds on $\varrho_{XY}$ in terms of $\varrho_{XZ}$ and $\varrho_{YZ}$.
In particular, if $X$ and $Z$ are negatively correlated, and $Y$ and $Z$ are negatively correlated, does this imply anything about the correlation between $X$ and $Y$? When must they be positively correlated?
