If $n$ boys and $n$ girls are tasked with making groups between themselves (any number, and of any size), what is the probability every group will consist of an equal number of boys and girls? Assume these people make groups by producing a permutation of $\\{1,2,\dots,2n\\}$ uniformly at random, and letting their groups be defined by the permutations' cycles.
