Consider an iid sample (X_i) of size n from a standard normal distribution.
If n=2, find E[X_(k)], V[X_(k)] and M_{X_(k)}(t) for k=1,2.
If n=3, find E[X_(k)] and V[X_(k)] for k=1,2,3.
For arbitrary n >= 1, and for arbitrary 1 <= k,m <= n, find Cov(X_(k), X_m).
(probably more stuff is possible to solve exactly with some more tricks)
