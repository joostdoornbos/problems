Construct a Lebesgue measurable set $A\subseteq \[0,1\]$ such that for any open interval $I\subseteq\[0,1\]$, $0\lt m(A \cap I)\lt m(I)$, where $m$ is Lebesgue measure.  
Prove there cannot exist a Lebesgue measurable set $A\subseteq \[0,1\]$ such that for any open interval $I\subseteq\[0,1\]$, $m(A\cap I) = \frac{m(I)}{2}$.
