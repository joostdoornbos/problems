Let G be the 2-dimensional, infinite, unit-square-grid graph. If you drop a noodle of length L, what is the maximum (over all lengths L>=0) probability of intersecting exactly 1 edge?
What about the d-dimensional grid?
What about intersecting n arcs?
What is the probability if, instead of maximizing, we have a random length according to some suitable distribution?
